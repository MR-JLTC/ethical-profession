# What is ethical hacking
Ethical hacking, also known as white hat hacking, is the practice of using hacking techniques for the purpose of identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks. Ethical hackers use their skills to improve the security of systems and protect them from malicious attacks, rather than exploiting vulnerabilities for personal gain or causing harm.

# what are the types of hackers?

### </b>There are several types of hackers</b>:

<b>White hat hackers</b>: These are ethical hackers who use their skills for defensive purposes, such as identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in systems.

<b> black hat hackers</b>: These are malicious hackers who use their skills to gain unauthorized access to systems or to steal sensitive information.

<b>Grey hat hackers</b>: These hackers may sometimes act ethically and at other times may cross ethical boundaries, depending on their motivations.

<b>Script kiddies</b>: These are individuals who use pre-written scripts or tools to attack systems without fully understanding how they work.

# what are the step of ethical hacking?
Here are the steps involved in ethical hacking:

<b>Planning and preparation</b>: Before starting an ethical hacking project, it is important to plan and prepare. This includes identifying the target system, obtaining permission to perform the hack, and creating a report to document the process.

<b>Reconnaissance</b>: In this step, the ethical hacker gathers as much information as possible about the target system, including IP addresses, open ports, and system vulnerabilities.

<b>Scanning</b>: The ethical hacker uses tools and techniques to scan the target system for vulnerabilities.

<b>Gaining access</b>: Once vulnerabilities have been identified, the ethical hacker attempts to gain access to the system using various techniques.

<b>Maintaining access</b>: Once access has been gained, the ethical hacker may try to maintain access to the system in order to continue testing and identifying vulnerabilities.

<b>Covering tracks</b>: In this step, the ethical hacker makes sure to cover their tracks and remove any evidence of their presence on the system.

<b>Reporting</b>: Finally, the ethical hacker creates a report detailing the vulnerabilities identified and the steps taken to fix them.



# why to learn ethical hacking?
### here are several reasons to learn ethical hacking:

<b>To improve the security of systems</b>: By identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, ethical hackers can help prevent malicious attacks on systems.

<b>To pursue a career in cybersecurity</b>: Ethical hacking is a highly sought-after skill in the field of cybersecurity, and learning ethical hacking can open up career opportunities in this field.

<b>To understand how to protect oneself online</b>: Learning about ethical hacking can also help individuals protect their own personal and financial information online.



# how to learn ethical hacking
There are several ways to learn ethical hacking:

<b>Online courses</b>: There are many online courses available that teach ethical hacking skills. These courses can be self-paced and often include videos, tutorials, and hands-on exercises to help students learn the skills.

<b>Books</b>: There are also many books available on ethical hacking, ranging from beginner to advanced levels. These books can be a good resource for learning the fundamentals and expanding your knowledge.

<b>Boot camps</b>: Ethical hacking boot camps are intensive, in-person training programs that provide hands-on experience with hacking tools and techniques. These programs are typically more expensive than online courses but can provide a more immersive learning experience.

<b>Practical experience</b>: The best way to learn ethical hacking is through hands-on experience. This can be achieved by setting up your own test lab and practicing on vulnerable systems, participating in online hacking challenges or Capture the Flag (CTF) events, or joining a hacking group and learning from more experienced hackers.

<i><b>It's important to note that learning ethical hacking requires a strong foundation in computer science and a deep understanding of computer systems and networks. Therefore, it's a good idea to start by building these foundational skills before diving into more advanced topics.</b></i>

NOTE - First learn C/c++ Language before start hacking. You can learn other languages while learning hacking at the same time/day.

Python courses are given at the bottom (you can do python now or after learning Basic ethical hacking.

SQL - Sql is one of the important languages in this field because there are many attacks. If we have good knowledge about SQL we can exploit databases with more ease.
